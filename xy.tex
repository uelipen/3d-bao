{\it Introduction.}---The observed large-scale structure provides ...
In this Letter, we solve the nonlinear displecement field from the nonlinear 
density field and present a new method to reconstruct the primordial density
field and hence the linear BAO information.

The analysis usually uses the density field directly. measure the power spectrum
However, modeling the small-scale inhomogeneities limits to $k<0.1\ h/\mr{Mpc}$.
We find the nonlinearities in the displacement field is much more linear than 
the density field. The correlation of the divergence of the displacement field
with the primordial (linear) density field is much better than that of the 
nonlinear density field. The divergence of the reconstructed nonlinear
displacement gives the reconstructed density field, which is much more linear
than the nonlinear density field.

{\it Displacement decomposition.}---In the Lagrangian picture of structure 
formation, 
the displacement field $\bm{s}(\bm{q},\tau)$ fully describes the motion of each mass element. The Eulerian position $\bm{x}$ of a mass element is given by
\bea
\bm{x}(\bm{q},\tau)=\bm{q}+\bm{s}(\bm{q},\tau),
\eea
where $\bm{q}$ is the initial Lagrangian position of this mass element.
The displacement field $\bm{s}(\bm{q})$ can be decomposed into a gradient part
and a curl part,
\bea
\bm{s}(\bm{q})=\bm{s}_E(\bm{q})+\bm{s}_B(\bm{q}),
\eea
where $\nabla\times\bm{s}_E=0$ and $\nabla\cdot\bm{s}_B=0$.
The gradient part can be completely described by a scalar potential,
while the curl part has two independent components.

In the 1D cosmology, the displacement field has only one component though 
it is a vector field \cite{2016matt}. 
This allows us to determine the displacement field, which is a vector field, 
from the density field, which is a scalar field \cite{2016arXiv160907041Z}.
However, the motion has three degrees of freedom in 3D instead of one.
Since from cosmological observations we only have the density field, we expect 
to reconstruct the scalar part of the displacement field.

%=========

{\it Reconstruction algorithm.}---The basic idea is to build a curvilinear 
coordinate system $\bm{\xi}\equiv(\xi_1,\ \xi_2,\ \xi_3)$, where the mass per
volume element is constant \cite{1995ApJS..100..269P,1998ApJS..115...19P}. 
In order to determine the physical position of each grid point, we need to 
specify the Cartesian coordinate $\bm{x}(\bm{\xi},\ t)$ of each curvilinear 
coordinate.
As in Refs.\cite{1995ApJS..100..269P,1998ApJS..115...19P}, we define a coordinate transformation that is a pure gradient,
\bea
x^i=\xi^\mu\delta^i_\mu+\Delta x^i,
\eea
where
\bea
\Delta x^i\equiv\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial\xi^\nu}\delta^{i\nu}.
\eea
Here, $\Delta\bm{x}$ is called the {\it lattice displacement} and $\phi$ the 
{\it deformation potential} \cite{1995ApJS..100..269P,1998ApJS..115...19P}.
Here, Latin indices denote Cartesian coordinate labels $x^i$, Greek indices 
imply curvilinear coordinates $\xi^\alpha$.

One efficient algorithm to solve the deformation potential is the moving mesh
method \cite{1995ApJS..100..269P,1998ApJS..115...19P}.
The moving mesh method is originally introduced for 
\bea
\partial_\mu(\rho\sqrt{g}e^\mu_i\delta^{i\nu}\partial_\nu\dot{\phi})=\Delta\rho,
\eea
where $\sqrt{g}=\mr{det}(\partial x^i/\partial \xi^\alpha)$ and 
$\Delta\rho=\bar{\rho}-\rho\sqrt{g}$



Thus, $\bm{\xi}$ is the estimated initial Lagrangian coordinate $\bm{q}$ and 
$\Delta \bm{x}(\bm{\xi})=\bm{x}-\bm{\xi}$ is the estimated nonlinear Lagrangian
displacement field $\bm{s}_E(\bm{q})$, which describes the motion beyond the 
Zel'dovich approximation. 
In the case that particles follow a irrotational potential flow and no shell
crossing happens, the reconstructed displacement is exact up to a global 
spatial translation.
However, shell crossing happens in the nonlinear regime and limits the 
reconstruction.


%The reconstructed density field $\delta_r(\bm{\xi})$ is given by 
%\bea
%\delta_r(\bm{\xi})=-\nabla_{\bm{\xi}}\cdot\Delta\bm{x}(\bm{\xi}).
%\eea

{\it Implementation and results.}---To test the performance of 
the new reconstruction algorithm, we run $N$-body simulations with 
the $\mr{CUBEP}^3\mr{M}$ code \cite{2013code}.
The simulation involves $2048^3$ dark matter particles in a box of 
side length $600\ \mr{Mpc}/h$.
In the analysis, we use the output at $z=0$. Mass densities are computed
on $512^3$ grids. 
The reconstructed ... 1500 times.
We also scale the initial density field at $z=100$ by 
the linear growth factor to get the linear density field at $z=0$.

Figure \ref{fig:den} shows a slice of the nonlinear density field. 
We overplot the deformed grid on the density field.

{\it Discussions.}---
The reconstructed nonlinear displacement can be further ...
before apply to real data, consider RSD, halo fields, SDSS main samples ...
Peculiar velocity cosmology, predicting the displacement, robust measurement of
vlomue weighted velocity field, free of sampling artifact, and good at 
predicting the velocity field from the density field. also important for the
kSZ reconstruction

neutrino mass measurement, nonlinearity is fully exploitted. also important for
the velocity field reconstruction for measuring the dipole
